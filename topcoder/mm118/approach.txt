My solution is an ugly mess since originally I assumed that I'm going to spend significant time on it. Failed at that. And then on the last day, frantically tried to squeeze out as many points as possible.

My basic solution is SA with kicks (random forced perturbations). My solution for single color is similar to what sullyper described.

My moves are: (a) erase and create new path (b) modify existing path in a way that affects only 2 cells.
The idea behind having only very short moves was to synergize with O(1) eval [not implemented] function cell-based and edge-based [not implemented] and with only 2 affected cells you can write a fast heuristic that in O(1) will be able to handle a lot of cases for component-based function [obviously not implemented].

One trick that worked particularly well (especially for filling diagram with single color) was to start from corners and gradually fill towards the middle. I used a similar technique for general case trying to minimize score while only considering outside cells.

Other things that I haven't implemented:
- When going for single color tests, try to spread the initial paths evenly around the diagram
- Alternative way would be to force paths going through specific cells.
- Exploit the fact that all of (b) affect only 2 cells and create complex moves that affect a pair of cells that doesn't have to be neighboring.
- Experiment more with different outside->inside orders.

That was a really cool problem.

PS. At the end of the contest I submitted 2 solutions right after another (because it worked!). And now I'm sitting with a rather unimpressive score.
